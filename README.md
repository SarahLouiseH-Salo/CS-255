# Driver Pass

The client, DriverPass, would like to meet their goal of filling in a seemingly blank spot between new drivers and obtaining their drivers' license: to offer online and on the road classes on the student's time.

I would say that my strengths lie in the descriptive aspect of system development: Use case diagrams and descriptive text come naturally to me. However, implementing them into a UML Class diagram is difficult; I tend to overstate my intents in the system, not focusing on the basic infrastructure. 
By breaking down the user's needs into a bulleted list, it is easy to interpret their wants and their needs, and prioritize what is important to the client. It's imperative that we listen to the client during every point of the process, and their wants and needs change as well as when there are roadblocks ran into during the development of their software.
